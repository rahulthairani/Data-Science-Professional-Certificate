# Data-Science-Professional-Certificate

[Data Science Professional Certificate - HarvardX](https://www.edx.org/professional-certificate/harvardx-data-science)

### What you will learn:

   - Fundamental R programming skills

   - Statistical concepts such as probability, inference, and modeling and how to apply them in practice

   - Gain experience with the `tidyverse`, including data visualization with `ggplot2` and data wrangling with `dplyr`

   - Become familiar with essential tools for practicing data scientists such as Unix/Linux, git and GitHub, and RStudio

   - Implement machine learning algorithms

   - In-depth knowledge of fundamental data science concepts through motivating real-world case studies
   
### Program Overview

The demand for skilled data science practitioners in industry, academia, and government is rapidly growing. The HarvardX Data Science program prepares you with the necessary knowledge base and useful skills to tackle real-world data analysis challenges. The program covers concepts such as probability, inference, regression, and machine learning and helps you develop an essential skill set that includes R programming, data wrangling with `dplyr`, data visualization with `ggplot2`, file organization with Unix/Linux, version control with git and GitHub, and reproducible document preparation with RStudio.

In each course, we use motivating case studies, ask specific questions, and learn by answering these through data analysis. Case studies include: Trends in World Health and Economics, US Crime Rates, The Financial Crisis of 2007-2008, Election Forecasting, Building a Baseball Team (inspired by Moneyball), and Movie Recommendation Systems.

Throughout the program, we will be using the R software environment. You will learn R, statistical concepts, and data analysis techniques simultaneously. We believe that you can better retain R knowledge when you learn how to solve a specific problem.

## Data Science: R Basics

Build a foundation in R and learn how to wrangle, analyze, and visualize data.

### About this course

The first in our Professional Certificate Program in Data Science, this course will introduce you to the basics of R programming. You can better retain R when you learn it to solve a specific problem, so you'll use a real-world dataset about crime in the United States. You will learn the R skills needed to answer essential questions about differences in crime across the different states.

We'll cover R's functions and data types, then tackle how to operate on vectors and when to use advanced functions like sorting. You'll learn how to apply general programming features like "`if`-`else`," and "`for` loop" commands, and how to wrangle, analyze and visualize data.

Rather than covering every R skill you might need, you'll build a strong foundation to prepare you for the more in-depth courses later in the series, where we cover concepts like probability, inference, regression, and machine learning. We help you develop a skill set that includes R programming, data wrangling with ```dplyr```, data visualization with `ggplot2`, file organization with UNIX/Linux, version control with git and GitHub, and reproducible document preparation with RStudio.

The demand for skilled data science practitioners is rapidly growing, and this series prepares you to tackle real-world data analysis challenges.

### What you'll learn

   - Basic R syntax
   - Foundational R programming concepts such as data types, vectors arithmetic, and indexing
   - How to perform operations in R including sorting, data wrangling using `dplyr`, and making plots
