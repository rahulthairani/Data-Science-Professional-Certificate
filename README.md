### Program Overview

The demand for skilled data science practitioners in industry, academia, and government is rapidly growing. The HarvardX Data Science program prepares you with the necessary knowledge base and useful skills to tackle real-world data analysis challenges. The program covers concepts such as probability, inference, regression, and machine learning and helps you develop an essential skill set that includes R programming, data wrangling with `dplyr`, data visualization with `ggplot2`, file organization with Unix/Linux, version control with git and GitHub, and reproducible document preparation with RStudio.

In each course, we use motivating case studies, ask specific questions, and learn by answering these through data analysis. Case studies include: Trends in World Health and Economics, US Crime Rates, The Financial Crisis of 2007-2008, Election Forecasting, Building a Baseball Team (inspired by Moneyball), and Movie Recommendation Systems.

Throughout the program, we will be using the R software environment. You will learn R, statistical concepts, and data analysis techniques simultaneously. We believe that you can better retain R knowledge when you learn how to solve a specific problem.

## Data Science: R Basics

**[`https://www.edx.org/course/data-science-r-basics`](https://www.edx.org/course/data-science-r-basics "Course Description")**

Build a foundation in R and learn how to wrangle, analyze, and visualize data.

### About this course

The first in our Professional Certificate Program in Data Science, this course will introduce you to the basics of R programming. You can better retain R when you learn it to solve a specific problem, so you'll use a real-world dataset about crime in the United States. You will learn the R skills needed to answer essential questions about differences in crime across the different states.

We'll cover R's functions and data types, then tackle how to operate on vectors and when to use advanced functions like sorting. You'll learn how to apply general programming features like "`if`-`else`," and "`for` loop" commands, and how to wrangle, analyze and visualize data.

Rather than covering every R skill you might need, you'll build a strong foundation to prepare you for the more in-depth courses later in the series, where we cover concepts like probability, inference, regression, and machine learning. We help you develop a skill set that includes R programming, data wrangling with ```dplyr```, data visualization with `ggplot2`, file organization with UNIX/Linux, version control with git and GitHub, and reproducible document preparation with RStudio.

The demand for skilled data science practitioners is rapidly growing, and this series prepares you to tackle real-world data analysis challenges.

### What you'll learn

   - Basic R syntax
   - Foundational R programming concepts such as data types, vectors arithmetic, and indexing
   - How to perform operations in R including sorting, data wrangling using `dplyr`, and making plots
   
1 - 2 hours per week for 8 weeks

## Data Science: Visualization

**[`https://www.edx.org/course/data-science-visualization`](https://www.edx.org/course/data-science-visualization "Course Description")**

Learn basic data visualization principles and how to apply them using `ggplot2`.

### About this course

As part of our Professional Certificate Program in Data Science, this course covers the basics of data visualization and exploratory data analysis. We will use three motivating examples and `ggplot2`, a data visualization package for the statistical programming language R. We will start with simple datasets and then graduate to case studies about world health, economics, and infectious disease trends in the United States.

We'll also be looking at how mistakes, biases, systematic errors, and other unexpected problems often lead to data that should be handled with care. The fact that it can be difficult or impossible to notice a mistake within a dataset makes data visualization particularly important.

The growing availability of informative datasets and software tools has led to increased reliance on data visualizations across many areas. Data visualization provides a powerful way to communicate data-driven findings, motivate analyses, and detect flaws. This course will give you the skills you need to leverage data to reveal valuable insights and advance your career.

### What you'll learn

   - Data visualization principles
   - How to communicate data-driven findings
   - How to use `ggplot2` to create custom plots
   - The weaknesses of several widely-used plots and why you should avoid them

1 - 2 hours per week for 8 weeeks

## Data Science: Probability

**[`https://www.edx.org/course/data-science-probability`](https://www.edx.org/course/data-science-probability "Course Description")**

Learn probability theory -- essential for a data scientist -- using a case study on the financial crisis of 2007-2008.

### About this course

In this course, part of our Professional Certificate Program in Data Science,you will learn valuable concepts in probability theory. The motivation for this course is the circumstances surrounding the financial crisis of 2007-2008. Part of what caused this financial crisis was that the risk of some securities sold by financial institutions was underestimated. To begin to understand this very complicated event, we need to understand the basics of probability.

We will introduce important concepts such as random variables, independence, Monte Carlo simulations, expected values, standard errors, and the Central Limit Theorem. These statistical concepts are fundamental to conducting statistical tests on data and understanding whether the data you are analyzing is likely occurring due to an experimental method or to chance.

Probability theory is the mathematical foundation of statistical inference which is indispensable for analyzing data affected by chance, and thus essential for data scientists.

### What you'll learn

   - Important concepts in probability theory including random variables and independence
   - How to perform a Monte Carlo simulation
   - The meaning of expected values and standard errors and how to compute them in R
   - The importance of the Central Limit Theorem

1 - 2 hours per week for 8 weeks

## Data Science: Inference and Modeling

**[`https://www.edx.org/course/data-science-inference-and-modeling`](https://www.edx.org/course/data-science-inference-and-modeling "Course Description")**

Learn inference and modeling, two of the most widely used statistical tools in data analysis.

### About this course

Statistical inference and modeling are indispensable for analyzing data affected by chance, and thus essential for data scientists. In this course, you will learn these key concepts through a motivating case study on election forecasting.

This course will show you how inference and modeling can be applied to develop the statistical approaches that make polls an effective tool and we'll show you how to do this using R. You will learn concepts necessary to define estimates and margins of errors and learn how you can use these to make predictions relatively well and also provide an estimate of the precision of your forecast.

Once you learn this you will be able to understand two concepts that are ubiquitous in data science: confidence intervals, and p-values. Then, to understand statements about the probability of a candidate winning, you will learn about Bayesian modeling. Finally, at the end of the course, we will put it all together to recreate a simplified version of an election forecast model and apply it to the 2016 election.

### What you'll learn

   - The concepts necessary to define estimates and margins of errors of populations, parameters, estimates and standard errors in order to make predictions about data
   - How to use models to aggregatedata from different sources
   - The very basics of Bayesian statistics and predictive modeling
